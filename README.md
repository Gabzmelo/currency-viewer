## Technologies Used

-   Vue
-   Axios
-   Chart.js

## Why Vue?

Vue was chosen for its ability to easily create interactive and reactive user interfaces. Additionally, Vue has an active community and extensive documentation, making it easy to find support and additional resources, especially with plugins like Chart.js and Axios.

## Why Axios?

Axios was chosen because it provides a simple and easy way to make HTTP requests, making communication with backend APIs more efficient. With Axios, it's easy to handle different types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and also work with asynchronous responses using Promises or async/await.

## Why Chart.js?

Chart.js was chosen because it offers a wide variety of chart types, including bars, lines, pie charts, radar, and more. It also allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive data visualizations directly in the browser, making data presentation more engaging and informative for users. It's easy to use and has comprehensive documentation, making it easy to customize charts according to project needs.

In summary, Vue, Axios, and Chart.js were chosen for the project due to their ease of use, efficiency, and ability to provide a rich and interactive user experience.
